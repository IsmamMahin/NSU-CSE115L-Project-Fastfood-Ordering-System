# NSU-CSE115L-Project-Fastfood_Ordering-System
 It is a project for my CSE115 lab course in university
 It first has a splashscreen that shows the name of the app or in this case name of the restaurant
 Then a music plays
 After the music it goes to login stage where users can signup or signin
 The user data is stored in login.txt file
 After login the food menu pops up where users can choose their desired food and the quantity
 After confirming order they can see total cost of purchase
 Then they can proceed to providing their address
 After that they can choose method of payment
 The they can choose to keep a copy of the invoice
 Finally the program closes with a thank you and an image of the delivery guy (^w*)
